            <h1>About</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>I've worn a couple of very unrelated hats in professional settings. I spent my undergraduate years studying and interning in the marine biology space, 
                studying fisheries and shark ecology. I loved that work, but I found that I lacked the power to make real change without knowledge of how to wield 
                more powerful computing tools. As such, after a brief stint in strategy consulting, I've made the decision to pivot into the software engineering world.
            </p>
            <p>My hope here is to work for a company that can help me build my software engineering skills, with the end goal of transitioning those skills to work 
                for a cause I care about in the future (such as marine biology conservation). Ultimately, the pressures that the underwater ecosystems of the world 
                face represent an existential threat, not just to their survival, but to the continuing survival of the human race. Building the tools necessary to 
                solve these problems is one of the greatest challenges of our time, and I look forward to my role in that effort.
